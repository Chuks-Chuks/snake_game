snake game

Snake game including two difficulty levels. 
Food categories: big food and small food. The former showing up on the screen after the snake has swallowed 5 green balls. 
The game has improved and employed my knowledge on co-ordinates on Turtle graphics, list and tuple slicing (love it as it was very effective for the project)
and finally what would I do without my darling OOP!

** There is a wee glitch (neglible but--yeah, yeah--bad for UI) when the snake is on the +ve ycor() and -ve xcor(). The segments separate but follow the same trail.**

Once tackled, I would update but for now enjoy this. 

The edge cases have been resolved. 

ENJOY!
